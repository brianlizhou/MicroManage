# BlastRun
 
2-D Interactive Scroller

//Further Development - Add methods to stop repetition of code for each stage 

//Further Development - Make survival mode with endless asteroids

//Further Development - Create rectangle borders around to stop rocketship from going out of screen

//Further Development - Develop better objects and image detection for collision (shapes perhaps?)

//KNOWN BUG - If you don't click Return to Main Menu button within 10 seconds when you win or lose, button does not function properly

//KNOWN BUG Intersection is loosely defined, not tightly bound around objects

//ADDITIONAL FEATURE: Move Diagonally rather than simply left or right

//ADDITIONAL FEATURE: Add Cheat codes on case presses for T,G,etc that give invulnerability and other abilities.

//ADDITIONAL Feature: Add blaster to destroy asteroids and code in animation


//Long Term ADDITIONAL FEATURE: Make map extremely large and scrollable, more to explore while dodging asteroids

//Work on project postponed until mid-March 2016 (Spring break)

//Fundamentals of game are finished - Try it out if you have time! Run Main.java in Eclipse to play.
